--Recursive CTE
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Categories (
    Category_Id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    Category_Name TEXT UNIQUE,
    Parent_Category_Id INTEGER NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (Parent_Category_Id) REFERENCES Categories(Category_Id)
);
INSERT INTO Categories (Category_Name, Parent_Category_Id) VALUES
('Electronics', NULL),
('Auto & Accessories', NULL),
('Mobile Accessories', 1),

WITH RECURSIVE CategoryHierarchy AS (
    SELECT 
        Category_Id,
        Parent_Category_Id,
        Category_Name,
        0 AS Level
    FROM Categories
    WHERE Parent_Category_Id IS NULL

    UNION ALL

    SELECT 
        c.Category_Id,
        c.Parent_Category_Id,
        c.Category_Name,
        ch.Level + 1
    FROM Categories c
    JOIN CategoryHierarchy ch 
        ON c.Parent_Category_Id = ch.Category_Id
)
SELECT *

--‚úÖ Insight: Uses a CTE to improve readability and efficiency.

--Indexing for Query Optimization
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_date ON Orders(Order_Date);
-- composite INDEX
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer_product 
ON Orders(Customer_Id, Product_Id);
--query PLAN
EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN
SELECT *
FROM Orders
WHERE Order_Date BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2019-12-31';
--‚úÖ Benefit: Indexes speed up data retrieval by allowing the database to find data without scanning every row.

--Partitioning for Efficient Querying - Partitioning Sales Data by Month
CREATE TABLE Orders_Partitioned (
    Order_Id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    Order_Date TEXT,
    Sales REAL,
    Partition_Key TEXT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (strftime('%Y-%m', Order_Date)) VIRTUAL
);

CREATE INDEX idx_partition ON Orders_Partitioned(Partition_Key);
--‚úÖ Benefit: Queries on Orders by month will be significantly faster.
